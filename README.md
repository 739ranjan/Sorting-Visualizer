# Sorting Visualization

This React project visualizes sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Quick Sort. It leverages the useState and useEffect hooks, along with setInterval to introduce delays in iterations, enabling smooth and dynamic visualization of the sorting processes.

A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list of elements in an order.
Following sorting algorithms has been implemented in this project:
 - Bubble Sort
 - Insertion Sort
 - Selection Sort

## Bubble sort
Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity are quite high.

## Insertion sort
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by iteratively inserting each element of an unsorted list into its correct position in a sorted portion of the list. It is like sorting playing cards in your hands. You split the cards into two groups: the sorted cards and the unsorted cards. Then, you pick a card from the unsorted group and put it in the right place in the sorted group.

## Selection Sort
Selection Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. It sorts an array by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion and swapping it with the first unsorted element. This process continues until the entire array is sorted.
